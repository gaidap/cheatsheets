# Getting Started with Cheatsheets

This is a little learning project to get familiar with React and TypeScript.  
It assambles a little notebook application that you can use to write, execute and store little code snippets written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  
  
You might have to disable your script blocker. Notice that uMatrix (https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues/926) get you some error message with the csp headers but you can ignore them, the app will work normally.

Note: As technical trade off I decided not to provide a second server to serve the iFrame content hence you cannot use localStorage, cookies or some other browser related features from your code snippets.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
