# The Cheatsheets local API
This API works as a facade for our Cheatsheets react application. So it won't be necessary to start the create-react-app process.
  
Instead we will will provide a simple API with express to fetch the needed js and html files to use Cheatsheets.  
This will be much faster and more effective in storage terms.
